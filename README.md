# TransPairs

The code in this repository was used to perform the transmission analysis described in the following paper:

Eldholm et al (2016) Impact of HIV co-infection on the evolution and transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. 
Elife 5:e16644

The `anaPairs` script returns the pairwise matrix of likelihoods of transmission from any host to any other. The `edmunds` script extract from this matrix the most likely transmission events. The comments in these two files provide more information about how to use them. The Methods section of the paper provides an explanation of the methodology implemented here.
